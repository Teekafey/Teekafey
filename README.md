- 👋 Hi, I’m Treasure Okafor.
- 👩🏽‍💻 I'm interested in SQL, Database Development, and Database Administration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PL/SQL, T-SQL, Python, Linux, and Data management.
- 👯‍♀️ Open to connect and collaborate on intermediate level projects around Database Development and Administration.
- 😎 Fun fact: When I'm not writing queries, you can find me taking on a challenge against an online Scrabble player, listening to classic lo-fi, or engrossed in a good book.
